This is the FEniCS code for Paper 5 in my PhD thesis. It contains 6 files. 

1) The code 'Scheme1Paper2.ipynb' contains codes to produce the values in Table 1 (chosen nx = 64), and computational time and error in Table 2 in Section 5.3 for scheme 1 and scheme 1 (precomputing).
2) The code 'Scheme2Paper2.ipynb' contains codes to produce Figures 3-5 in Section 5.2 with scheme 2 and scheme 2 (precomputing).
3) The code 'Scheme2Paper2Section53.ipynb' contains codes to produce the values in Table 2 in Section 5.3. It produces computational time and error in Table 2 for scheme 2 and scheme 2 (precomputing). It also produces Figure 6.
4) The code 'Scheme2_pre_convergence_order.ipynb' contains codes to produce the values in Table 3 in Section 5.3 with scheme 2 (precomputing). It also produces Figure 7.
5) The code 'Scheme2_pre_OC_time.ipynb' contains codes to calculate the convergence order in time used in Section 5.3 with scheme 2 (precomputing). It also produces Figure 8.
6) The code 'Scheme2_non_hom_Dirichlet.ipynb' contains codes to produce Figure 9 and Figure 10 in Section 5.4 with scheme 2 (precomputing).
